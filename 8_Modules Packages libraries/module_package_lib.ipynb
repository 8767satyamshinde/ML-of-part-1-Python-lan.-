    "\n",
    "### Modules, Packages, and Libraries in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modules**\n",
    "   - A module is simply a Python file that contains code such as functions, classes, or variables. It helps organize code logically.\n",
    "   - To create a module, just save your code in a `.py` file.\n",
    "   - **Importing a Module**: You can import a module using the `import` statement.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # example_module.py\n",
    "   def greet(name):\n",
    "       return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   # another_file.py\n",
    "   import example_module\n",
    "   print(example_module.greet(\"Alice\"))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Importing Specific Functions/Classes**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from example_module import greet\n",
    "   print(greet(\"Bob\"))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Aliases for Modules**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import example_module as em\n",
    "   print(em.greet(\"Charlie\"))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Packages**\n",
    "   - A package is a collection of related modules stored in a directory. It usually includes an `__init__.py` file to mark the directory as a package.\n",
    "   - **Creating a Package**:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     my_package/\n",
    "     ├── __init__.py\n",
    "     ├── module1.py\n",
    "     └── module2.py\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Importing a Module from a Package**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from my_package import module1\n",
    "   module1.some_function()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Libraries**\n",
    "   - Libraries are collections of modules and packages providing pre-written functionality. Examples include NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.\n",
    "   - **Installing Libraries**: Libraries can be installed using `pip` (Python's package manager).\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install numpy\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Using Installed Libraries**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import numpy as np\n",
    "   arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "   print(arr)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The Special Variable `__name__`**\n",
    "   - The `__name__` variable allows you to check whether a module is being run directly or imported.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # example_module.py\n",
    "   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "       print(\"This module is run directly\")\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       print(\"This module is imported\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: When a file is executed directly, `__name__` is set to `\"__main__\"`. When imported, it contains the module’s name.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Points to Remember**\n",
    "   - Use modules to organize related code and functions.\n",
    "   - Use packages to group related modules and promote reusability.\n",
    "   - Libraries offer pre-built solutions to complex problems.\n",
    "   - Understand the significance of `__name__ == \"__main__\"` for module execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
