# Pandas is a python package providing fast , flexible and expressive data stru. designed to make working with "relational" data both easy  and  intuitive.
# here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:  It has funtions for analyzing , cleaning , exploring , and manipulating data.
# The name "Pandas" has a referance  to both "Panel Data" , and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.




##  Pandas Application  ##

# Easy handling of missing data.
# Size mutability: colums can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimentional objects.
# Automatic and explicit data alignment: object can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels , or the user can simply ignore the labels and let Seeries, DataFrame, ... etc.
# Automatically align the data for you in computations.
# Powerful, flexible group by fintioality.
#Intelligent label-based slicing , fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data set.
# Intuitive merging and pivoting of data sets.



####   Data Structure in   ###
The best way to think about the pandas data structure is as flexible containers for lower dimention data. For example Dataframe is a container for Series, and Series is a continer for scalars.  We would like to be able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like fashion.


###   Series in Pandas   ###
Pandas series is a one-dimention labeld array capable of holding data of any type(integer , string , float, python Object, ...ect.). The axis labels are collectively called index. Pandas Series is nothing but a column in an exce sheet.


###   DataFrame   ###
Pandas Dataframe is 2-D size-mutable , potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labled axes (rows and column). A Data frame is a 2-D data stru. , i.e., data is aligned in a tabular fashion in row and column. Pandas DataFrame consists of three principal components, the data , rows and columns.
